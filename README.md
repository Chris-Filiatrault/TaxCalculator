## Tax Calculator

A 2-tier web application with a simple UI and API.
Built using .NET

The application builds off work from a [coding assignment](https://github.com/Chris-Filiatrault/coding-assignment), the result of which produced a console application for calculating tax.

This project is purely for learning purposes. The idea is the business problem (an application for calculating tax) and the business logic is well understood, so I can progressively add more features and focus purely on the technical aspect.

To date the project covers topics including:

- MVC pattern
- Inheritance
- Dependency Injection
- Routing
- Interfaces
- Access Modifiers
- Separation of Concerns
- Azure Deployment
- Razor Pages
- Bootstrap
- Unit Testing
