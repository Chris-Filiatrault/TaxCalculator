## Tax Calculator

.NET Web Application with a simple UI and API.

Both projects are live on Azure on separate resources.

- API is live [here](https://tax-calculator-api.azurewebsites.net/CalculateTax?totalPackage=100000) (single endpoint called CalclateTax)
- UI is live  [here](https://tax-calculator-ui.azurewebsites.net/)

The application builds off work from a [coding assignment](https://github.com/Chris-Filiatrault/coding-assignment), the result of which produced a console application with user input for calculating tax.

This project is purely for learning purposes. The idea is the business problem (calculating tax) is well understood, so I can progressively add more features and focus purely on the technical aspects.

To date the project covers topics including:

- MVC pattern
- Inheritance
- Dependency Injection
- Routing
- Interfaces
- Access Modifiers
- Separation of Concerns
- Azure Deployment
- Razor Pages
- Bootstrap
- Unit Testing
